# arabidopsis_local_adaptation
# 
#Early code for the early stages of the arabidposis experiment. The goal is to address the question, How does local adaptation #in a heterogeneous landscape impact the ability of species to coexist? 
#Code thus far is just statistical analyses to look at the intrinsic growth rates of different arabidopsis RILs across a
gradient of soil/sand mixtures.
